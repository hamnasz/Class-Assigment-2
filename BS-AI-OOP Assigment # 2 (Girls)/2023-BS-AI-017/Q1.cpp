    Question Statement
        Imagine a publishing company that markets both
        book and audiocassetie versions of its works.
        Create a class publication that stores the title
        (a string) and price (type float) of a publication.
        From this class derive two classes: book, which
        adds a page count (type int), and tape, which adds
        a playing me in minutes (type float).
        Each of these three classes should have a getdata()
        function to get its data from the user at the
        keyboard, and a putdata() function to display its
        data. Write a main() program to test the book and
        tape classes by creating instances of them,
        asking the user to fill in data with getdata(),
        and then displaying the data with putdata().Â */
